This is a Monophonic Synthesizer built with WebAudio and React.

I made it for funsies, and chose not to depend on libraries like tone.js

It has many features including
* recording
* arpeggiator
* usb midi controller support
* filters, effects, LFOs
* 3 Oscillators (sine, saw, trianle, square, pulse)

to run locally:
`npm install`
and then
`npm run start:dev`
